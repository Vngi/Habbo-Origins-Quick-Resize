### Notes

- **Client Issues**: Some aspects of "Origins" may not function correctly due to issues with the client.
- **Image Disclaimer**: The images displayed in this README are from an older version where these issues were not present.

### Run.bat

This repository includes a batch script (`Run.bat`) for automating the setup and execution of the Python script to manage window size and fullscreen mode on Windows.

### Usage Instructions

1. **Automatic Installation**:
   - Double-click the `Run.bat` file to run it.
   - If Python and necessary modules are not installed, the script will automatically download and install them.

2. **Manual Installation**:
   - If the automatic installation does not work, you can manually install:
     - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (version 3.x)
     - Open the `Run.bat` file with a text editor and follow the instructions within to install Python and modules manually.

3. **Running the Script**:
   - After installation, double-click `Run.bat` to automatically manage the window size and fullscreen mode of "Habbo Hotel: Origins".

### Notes

- Adjust Python version (`PYTHON_VERSION`) and module dependencies as needed in the script (`Run.bat`).
- Ensure an active internet connection during installation for downloading Python and modules.
